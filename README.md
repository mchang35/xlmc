Website to document the love story of Mandy Chang and Xue Lor!

Ideas:
 - have a gallery for photos
 - use React.js for pages that show photos from trips
 - password protected
 - dynamic -- Xue can add photos and special dates too
 - have a page for special dates... maybe like a vertical timeline with some pictures? dates can also link to photos from trips
 - use Canva to come up with the visuals and how I want it to look

Pages
 - Login page -- this is password protected
 - Trips Together (has a list of all trips we've taken together -- when click on one, we go to Event/Trip page for that trip)
 - Special Dates (vertical timeline with links to each Event/Trip page)
 - Event/Trip Page -- has description and photo gallery for event/trip
 - Business Ideas -- a link to our Google Drive?
